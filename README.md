# Module-5---Pyber-Analysis
Matlolib and Pandas


Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (20 points)
Deliverable 3 Instructions
Use your repository README file to write your analysis of how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.

# Overview of this Analysis 

This analysis intends to provide information on the fare trends across different city types namely, rural, suburban and Urban areas. 

The analysis should contain the following:

# Data Summary 

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## Query used in python via pandas to pull the required data summary from the data file.

# 3 Business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1) The average fare per ride in rural areas is significantly higher than urban areas by 41%. Creating more rides in Rural areas might be a good strategy for Pyber to increase total revenue from rides. 
2) The avergae fare per driver in rural areas is also significantly higher than urban areas by 234%. This is a great motivator to get more drivers to do rural routes by incentizing them with higher margins, 
3) Urban rides are 30x more than rural rides and 5x more than sub-urban city types which means supply of drivers is considerably higher here and is driving down the price. Incentizing drivers in rural and sub-urban areas can help increase the number of rides in those areas and increase the average fare of rides in urban areas by reducing driver supply and help with overall revenue across all the city types.
